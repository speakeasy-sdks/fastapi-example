1. Ensure `CLERK_API_SECRET_KEY` and `CLERK_AUTHORIZED_PARTIES` is set in your environment variables. `CLERK_AUTHORIZED_PARTIES` is a comma-separated list of allowed parties for example `http://localhost:5173`

2. Install dependencies with 
```commandline
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run `fastapi dev` to start the FastAPI server in development mode

4. From a Clerk frontend, use the `useSession` hook to retrieve the getToken() function:

```
const { getToken } = useSession();
```

5. Then, request the python server with:

```
await fetch("http://localhost:8000/clerk_jwt", {
    headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${await getToken()}`
    }
})
```
